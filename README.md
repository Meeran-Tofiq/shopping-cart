# Shopping Cart Project

This Single Page Application project, made using the React framework and React Router v6.

## Learning Outcomes

The site was made for an assignment given out by The Odin Project. It was intended to showcase a bunch of skills and learning outcomes from their course, such as:

### Single Page Application (SPA)

I learned how to use React Router to create a single page application. All our code is pre-loaded, that way th website feels smooth and very responsive when changing between the pages of the site.

### Fetching with React

I learned how to fetch properly in react using the useEffect hook. I also learned how to accomodate for cases of failure and error, or to display to the user that the data is still loading.

### Testing

By far the most important skill honed by this project. I was tasked to write tests for all our components and their functionalities, using Vitest.

It was challneging because I needed to mock many aspects of my components and the React Router api itself. This was somethign that I had never done before, and did not feel very confident in. But I persevered, and by Googling and asking my peers, I was able to make it work in the end.
